## Overview

### Neutrality
The Warden’s role is to act as a neutral arbiter and portray the rules, situations, non-player characters (NPCs), and narrative clearly.

### Classless
A character’s role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.

### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

### Fiction First
Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are based on in-world elements and arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players.

### Growth
Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they’ve made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

### Principles
The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Players

### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don’t ask only what your character would do; ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Warden’s description without suspicion, but don’t shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You’ll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor, and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research, and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition
- Set goals, and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward, and play to see what happens.

## Principles for Wardens

### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- NPCs don’t want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger
- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Treasure
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Artifacts are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary “so, A or B?” responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character’s actions leave their mark on the game world.

## Core Rules

### Attributes
- **Strength (STR):** Lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison.
- **Dexterity (DEX):** Poise, speed, reflexes, dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing.
- **Willpower (WIL):** Persuade, deceive, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells.

### Attribute Loss
If a PC’s STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious. Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

If they take damage outside of combat, they should instead receive damage to an Attribute, typically STR.

### Saves
Characters roll a d20 and compare the results to the appropriate attribute. If they roll equal to or under that attribute, they succeed. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

If two opponents are each trying to overcome the other, whoever is most at risk should save.

If two characters need to take an action together, whoever is most at risk should save (usually the character with the lowest relevant attribute).

### Die of Fate
Optionally, roll 1d6 whenever the outcome of an event is uncertain or to simulate an element of randomness and chance.

A roll of 4 or more generally favors the PCs, while a roll of 3 or under usually means bad luck for the PCs.

### Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is **Deprived**. Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. A **Deprived** PC cannot recover GD, Attributes, or item slots from **Fatigue**.

A PC may also be forced to add **Fatigue** due to events occurring in the fiction. Each **Fatigue** occupies one slot and lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full night’s rest in a safe spot).

If a character is forced to add **Fatigue** to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.

### Healing & Recovery
Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost GD but may leave the party exposed. Bandages can stabilize a character that has taken critical damage.

Attribute loss (see **Critical Damage**) can usually be restored with a week’s rest, facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.

Some healing services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

### Inventory
Characters have a total of ten inventory slots but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.

Each PC starts with a **Backpack** that can hold up to six slots of items or **Fatigue**. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can make a huge difference in how much a PC can bring with them on an adventure. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment.

Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 GD. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

### Inventory Slots
Most items take up one slot unless otherwise indicated. Petty items do not take up any slots. Bulky items take up two slots. A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is petty and does not occupy a slot.

### Hirelings
Adventuring parties can recruit hirelings, relying on their unique skills, knowledge, and training to aid in expeditions.

To create a hireling, choose an appropriate role from the Hirelings table in the Marketplace. Roll 3d6 for each attribute and 1d6 for their GD. Give them **equipment** appropriate to their station, then roll on the Character Traits tables to further flesh them out.

Alternatively, follow the **Character Creation** process but select the appropriate background, name, and gear for the character.

See [Quick Hirelings](#quick-hirelings) for some example characters that are ready to be dropped into your game.

### Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :-----: |
|  2      | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 |   12    |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

## Combat

### Guard
Guard (GD) reflects a character’s ability to avoid damage in combat.

### Armor
Before calculating damage to GD, subtract the target’s Armor value from the result of damage rolls.

Shields and similar armor may provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor).

A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than 3 Armor.

### Rounds
A Round is roughly 10 seconds of in-game time. Characters may move, and then perform an action.

During the first round of combat, each PC must make a DEX save in order to act. PCs that fail their save lose their turn for this round.

Their opponents then take their turn, and the first round ends. The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.

### Actions
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be casting a spell, attacking, moving for a second time, or some other reasonable action. Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Warden calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs.

### Attacking & Damage
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s GD. Attacks in combat automatically hit.

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. All actions are declared before being resolved.

If an attack would take a PC’s GD exactly to 0, refer to the **Scars** table to see how they are uniquely impacted.

### Attack Modifiers
If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is *Impaired*, and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attacks damage die. Unarmed attacks always do d4 damage.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is *Enhanced*, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

Attacks with the *Blast* quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. This can be anything from explosions to a dragon’s breath or the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result (denoted with a plus symbol, e.g. d8+d8).

### Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target’s GD below zero is subtracted from their STR by the amount of damage remaining. The target must then immediately make a STR save to avoid taking **Critical Damage**, using their new STR score. On a success, the target is still in the fight (albeit with a lower STR score) and must continue to make critical damage saves when incurring damage.

Any PC that suffers Critical Damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid (such as bandages), they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour. NPCs and monsters that fail a Critical Damage save are considered dead, per the **Warden’s** discretion. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

### Character Death
When a character dies, the player should create a new character or take control of a hireling. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single *Detachment*. When a *detachment* takes **Critical Damage**, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against *detachments* by individuals are *impaired* (excluding *blast* damage). Attacks against individuals by *detachments* are *enhanced* and deal *blast* damage.

### Retreat
Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Morale
Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader’s WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they’re reduced to 0 GD.

### Ranged Attacks
Ranged weapons can target any enemy near enough to see the whites of their eyes. Attacks against especially distant targets are *Impaired*.

Ammunition is not tracked unless otherwise specified.

### Scars
If damage to a PC would reduce their GD to exactly 0, look up the result on the table below based on the amount of GD lost in the attack. For example, if a PC went from 3 GD to 0 GD, they would look at entry #3 (Walloped).

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 1   | **Scarred:** Roll 1d6 \| 1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest, 5: Legs, 6: Ear. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                        |
| 2   | **Rattled:** You’re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                                 |
| 3   | **Walloped:** You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max GD.                                                         |
| 4   | **Broken Limb:** Roll 1d6 \| 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once mended, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                       |
| 5   | **Diseased:** You’re afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                           |
| 6   | **Head Wound:** Roll 1d6 \| 1-2: STR, 3-4: DEX, 5-6: WIL. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current ability score, take the new result.                                                                              |
| 7   | **Hamstrung:** You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max DEX, take the new result.                                                              |
| 8   | **Deafened:** You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4.                                                                              |
| 9   | **Re-brained:** Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.                                                                                    |
| 10  | **Sundered:** An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The Warden will tell you which. Then, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6.                                                                |
| 11  | **Mortal Wound:** You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max GD.                                                                         |
| 12  | **Doomed:** Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result. |

## Magic

### Spellbooks
Spellbooks contain a single spell and take up one slot. They cannot be easily transcribed or created; instead they are recovered from places like tombs, dungeons, and manors.

Spellbooks will attract the attention of those who seek the arcane power within, and it is considered dangerous to display them openly.

### Casting Spells
You may cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud, then **saving for corruption**.

To save for corruption first make a WIL save, adding your current **corruption** to the result. Failure requires a d20 roll on the **Fell Sorcery table**, again adding your current **corruption** to the result.

Regardless of the outcome, your **Corruption** then increases by 1.

### Fell Sorcery

## Dungeon Exploration
### The Basics
On their **turn**, a character can move a distance equal to their torchlight’s perimeter (about 40ft), and perform one **action**. Players can use their action to move up to three times that distance though that will increase the chance of triggering a roll on the **Dungeon Events** table.

The **Warden** should present obvious information about an area and its dangers freely. Moving quickly or without caution may increase the chance of encountering a wandering monster, springing a trap, or triggering a roll on the **Dungeon Events** table.

**Actions** are any non-passive activities, such as searching for traps, forcing open a door, listening for danger, disarming a trap, engaging an enemy in combat, casting a spell, dodging a trap, running away, resting, etc.

Some **actions** have special rules (see below), while others may take multiple **turns** to complete.
Loud or noticeable actions may trigger an encounter with the dungeon’s denizens.

### Searching
A character can spend a **turn** performing an exhaustive search of one object or location in an area, revealing any relevant hidden treasure, traps, secret doors, etc.

Larger rooms and difficult or complex dungeon terrain may take a few **turns** to properly search.
Searching a room first is a safer way to explore the dungeon, but it has a steep cost: time.

### Resting
With a light source and a safe location a character can spend a turn resting to restore all GD.

### Light
Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40ft of dungeon and beyond that only a dim outline of objects. Torches last until they are put out by a character or their environment.

A torch can be lit 3 times before permanently degrading while a lantern can be relit 6 times per oil can.

Characters without a light source may suffer from **panic** until their situation is remedied.

### Doors
Doors and entryways may be locked, stuck, or blocked entirely. Characters can try to force a door open (or wedge it shut) using available resources (spikes, glue) or through raw ability.

A character can detect, through careful observation (listening, smelling, etc.), signs of life and other hazards through nearby doors and walls.

### Traps
Cautious characters should be presented with any and all information that would allow them the opportunity to avoid springing a trap. Unwitting characters will trigger a trap according to the fiction, or otherwise will have a 2-in-6 chance.

Traps can usually be detected by carefully searching a room.

Damage from traps is taken from Attributes (usually STR or DEX) and not from GD. Armor can reduce damage, but only if applicable (e.g. a shield would not reduce damage from noxious gas).

### Panic
A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing their greatest fears may experience panic. A **WIL** save is typically required to avoid losing control and becoming panicked.

A panicked character must make a WIL save to overcome their condition as an action on their turn.

A panicked character has 0 GD, does not act in the first round of combat, and all of their attacks are *impaired*.

### Dungeon Exploration Cycle
- The Warden describes the party’s surroundings and any immediate dangers (combat, traps, surprises, etc.). The players then declare their character’s intended movements and actions.
- The Warden resolves the actions of each character simultaneously, along with any actions that are already in progress. Remember, the Die of Fate can be a useful tool whenever the Warden is in doubt!
- The players record any loss of resources and any new conditions (i.e. item use, deprivation, etc). The cycle then begins again. If appropriate, the Warden should roll on the Dungeon Events table. Keep common sense in mind when interpreting the results!

### Dungeon Events
Exploring a dungeon is always dangerous, and time must always be weighed against the risk of awakening the location’s denizens, natural hazards, and worse.

Roll on the table below when the party:
- Spends more than one dungeon cycle in a single room or location
- Moves quickly or haphazardly through a room
- Moves into a new area, level, or zone (not necessarily a new room)
- Creates a loud disturbance

|       |                 |                                                                                                           |
| :---: | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Encounter**   | Roll on an encounter table. Possibly **hostile**. (See [Reactions](#reactions).)                          |
| **2** | **Sign**        | A clue, spoor, track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, etc is discovered.                                   |
| **3** | **Environment** | Surroundings shift or escalate. Water rises, ceilings collapse, a ritual nears completion, etc.           |
| **4** | **Loss**        | Torches are blown out, an ongoing spell fizzles, etc. The party must resolve the effect before moving on. |
| **5** | **Exhaustion**  | The party must rest (triggering another roll on this table), add a **Fatigue**, or consume a ration.      |
| **6** | **Quiet**       | The party is left alone (and safe) for the time being.                                                    |

## Wilderness Exploration

### Watches
A day is divided into three **watches**, called morning, afternoon, and night. Each character can choose one **Wilderness Action** per watch. If the characters split up, each group is treated as an independent entity.

### Points
Potential destinations on a map are called **points**. One or more watches may be required to journey between two **points** on a map, depending on the path, terrain, weather, and party status. The party has a rough idea of the challenges involved to get to their destination, but rarely any specifics.

### Travel Duration
Travel time in is counted in watches, divided into three eight-hour segments per day.
To determine the distance between two points, combine all penalties from the path, terrain, and weather difficulty tables, taking into account any changes to those elements along the route. For travel via waterways, refer to the surrounding terrain difficulty. For especially vast terrain, assign a penalty of up to +2 watches to the journey.

The weather, terrain, darkness, injured party members, and other obstacles can impact travel or even make it impossible! In some cases, the party may need to add **Fatigue** or expend resources in order to sustain their pace. Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party’s travel speed or even negate certain penalties.

### Wilderness Elements

#### Night
The party can choose to travel during the night and rest during the day, but night travel is far slower and more treacherous!

When traveling at night the **Warden** should roll twice on the **Wilderness Events** table.

Some terrain and weather may be easier to traverse at night (desert, for example). The **Warden** should balance these challenges along with any other.

#### Sleep
The last watch of the day is typically reserved for the **Make Camp** action.

Characters typically need to sleep each day. Anything beyond a minor interruption can negate or cancel the benefits of sleep.

If the party skips the **Make Camp** action, they each add a **Fatigue** to their inventory and are deprived. Additionally, traveling when sleep-deprived raises the terrain **Difficulty** by a step (i.e. Easy becomes Tough).

#### Light
Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40ft ahead of the party, but beyond that only provides a dim outline of objects. Characters without a light source may suffer from panic until their situation is remedied. Environmental conditions (sudden gusts of wind, dust, water, etc.) can easily blow out a torch.

#### Light Sources
A torch can be lit 3 times before degrading. A lantern can be re-lit indefinitely but requires a separate oil can (6 uses).

### Weather
Each day, the Warden should roll on the weather table for the appropriate season. If the "**Extreme**" weather result is rolled twice in a row, the weather turns to "**Catastrophic**". A squall becomes a hurricane, a storm floods the valley, etc.

#### Weather Type

|        |            |            |            |            |
| :----: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| **d6** | **Spring** | **Summer** |  **Fall**  | **Winter** |
| **1**  |    Nice    |    Nice    |    Fair    |    Fair    |
| **2**  |    Fair    |    Nice    |    Fair    | Unpleasant |
| **3**  |    Fair    |    Fair    | Unpleasant | Inclement  |
| **4**  | Unpleasant | Unpleasant | Inclement  | Inclement  |
| **5**  | Inclement  | Inclement  | Inclement  |  Extreme   |
| **6**  |  Extreme   |  Extreme   |  Extreme   |  Extreme   |

#### Weather Difficulty

|                  |                                                                                                         |                                                           |
| :--------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **Weather**    | **Effect**                                                                                              | **Examples**                                              |
|     **Nice**     | Favorable conditions for travel.                                                                        | _Clear skies, sunny_                                      |
|     **Fair**     | Favorable conditions for travel.                                                                        | _Overcast, breezy_                                        |
|  **Unpleasant**  | Add a **Fatigue** _or_ add one **watch** to the journey.                                                | _Gusting winds, rain showers, sweltering heat, chill air_ |
|  **Inclement**   | Add a **Fatigue** _or_ add **+1 watch**. Increase terrain **Difficulty** by a step.  | _Thunderstorms, lightning, rain, muddy ground_           |
|   **Extreme**    | Add a **Fatigue** _and_ add **+1 watch**. Increase terrain **Difficulty** by a step. | _Blizzards, freezing winds, flooding, mud slides_         |
| **Catastrophic** | Most parties cannot travel under these conditions.                                                      | _Tornados, tidal waves, hurricane, volcanic eruption_     |

### Wilderness Exploration Cycle

1. The **Warden** describes the current **point** or **region** on the map and how the path, weather, terrain, or party status might affect **travel speed**. The party plots or adjusts a given course towards their destination. 
2. Each party member chooses a single **Wilderness Action**. The **Warden** narrates the results and then rolls on the [**Wilderness Events**](#wilderness-events) table. The party responds to the results.
3. The **players** and the **Warden** record any loss of resources and new conditions (i.e. torch use, _deprivation_, etc), and the cycle repeats. 

### Wilderness Events

| ----- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Encounter**   | Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for NPC [reactions](/second-edition/players-guide/core-rules.md/#reactions) if applicable.                                                                               |
| **2** | **Sign**        | The party discovers a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area.                                                                                      |
| **3** | **Environment** | A shift in weather or terrain.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **4** | **Loss**        | The party is faced with a choice that costs them a resource (rations, tools, etc), time, or effort.                                                                                                                        |
| **5** | **Exhaustion**  | The party encounters a barrier, forcing effort, care or delays. This might mean spending extra time (and an additional **Wilderness Action**) or adding **Fatigue** to the PC's inventory to represent their difficulties. |
| **6** | **Discovery**   | The party finds food, treasure, or other useful resources. The **Warden** can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area.   

### Wilderness Actions

#### Travel
Travel begins. Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby areas are revealed according to their distance. This action is typically taken by the entire party as one.

The party rolls 1d6 to see if they get lost along the way. This risk can increase or decrease, depending on path **Difficulty**, maps, party skills, and guides.

If lost, the party may need to spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way. Otherwise, the party reaches the next **point** along their route.

Remember to compare the results of getting lost to the relevant path **Difficulty**.

#### Explore
One or more party members search a large area, searching for hidden features, scouting ahead, or treading carefully.

A Location (shelter, village, cave, etc.) or Feature (geyser, underground river, beached ship, etc.) is discovered.

The **Travel** action is still required to leave the current area, even if it has been completely explored.

#### Supply
One or more party members may hunt, fish, or forage for food, collecting 1d4 Rations (3 uses each). The chance of a greater bounty increases with each additional participant (e.g. 1d4 becomes 1d6, up to a maximum of 1d12).

Relevant experience or equipment may also increase the bounty collected.

The party may encounter homes and small villages, spending gold and a full **watch** to resupply.

#### Make Camp
The party stops to set up camp in the wilds. Each party member (and their mounts) consumes a Ration.

A **lookout rotation** is set so that the party can sleep unmolested. A smaller party may need to risk sleeping unguarded or switch off sleeping over multiple days.

Party members that were able to rest remove all **Fatigue** from their inventory.

### Wilderness Exploration Cycle

The **Warden** describes the current **point** or **region** on the map and how the path, weather, terrain, or party status might affect **travel speed**. The party plots or adjusts a given course towards their destination.
Each party member chooses a single **Wilderness Action**. The **Warden** narrates the results and then rolls on the **Wilderness Events** table. The party responds to the results.

The **players** and the **Warden** record any loss of resources and new conditions (i.e. torch use, deprivation, etc), and the cycle repeats.

|       |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Encounter**   | Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for NPC [reactions](#reactions) if applicable.                                                                                          |
| **2** | **Sign**        | The party discovers a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area.                                                                                      |
| **3** | **Environment** | A shift in weather or terrain.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Downtime

Between game sessions, players can engage in a variety of activities such as research, following up on leads, improving skills, or building relationships. A PC is limited to one **Downtime Action** at a time. These actions cannot be undertaken in unsafe conditions or while a character is in recovery. A character cannot perform an action if it would put their safety at risk.

### Milestones
For activities requiring multiple steps, the **Warden** assigns 1-5 **Milestones** for players to track progress. Each **Milestone** represents a comprehensive, non-interactive task. The **Warden** may present different strategies to achieve these goals, each with distinct **Milestones**. Depending on the unfolding events in the game, the **Warden** is also empowered to introduce new **Milestones** or discard existing ones.

### Costs
PCs can complete individual **Milestones** by taking a **Downtime Action** and paying its respective Cost. If a **character** is unable to pay the **Cost**, they may have to find some other way to achieve their goal. A few examples of **Cost**:

- **Gold:** Direct payment of gold from a character’s inventory.
- **Resources:** Non-monetary costs such as material goods, specific common items, and so on.
- **Reputation:** Betting on a character’s renown, personality, presence, social connections, etc.
- **Loss:** Offering something specific and unique. A finger, a soul, an **Artifact**, etc.

Some **Costs** can be reduced or disregarded through character skills, connections, or force of will. For example, a PC may have already acquired the necessary reputation to gain access to a renowned institution, and thus the **cost** is abated. On the other hand, another character may not be so lucky and must rely on their force of personality instead. In this case, the Warden should state the risk (a permanent ban on entry, a loss of reputation, etc.). The PC then makes a WIL save; on a success, the cost is either reduced or avoided entirely.

### Downtime Actions
The following activities represent some of the most common **Downtime Actions** a players can choose. The **Warden** can also create custom actions based on the needs of play.

#### Research
A PC investigates a question about a bit of lost or forgotten lore, the location of a lost item, the whereabouts of an important NPC, and so on. To take this action, the player must have a clearly formulated question they’d like to answer and a Source of knowledge in the game world that their character can interact with. If the PC does not have a Source, then they can spend a Downtime Action trying to find one. There is no guarantee that they will be successful. Once a question is posed and an appropriate Source has been identified, the Warden should provide any Milestones and associated Costs.

#### Questions
As always, the question must come from an experience that occurred during play.

**Examples:**
- “Where is the **Lost Temple of The Crimson Moth**?”
- “Who in **Amber City** might know how to crack an ancient vault?”
- “Where can I find the cure to **ashen lung**?”

#### Sources
A **Source** is a person, place, faction, or entity that holds either a part or whole answer that the character seeks. They can be NPCs, Factions, spirits, or even other PCs.

**Examples:**
- **Kaligos the Hunter**, a renowned slayer of beasts who once aided the party but is now content to live out the rest of his days in obscurity. If anyone knows how to track the **Blood Elk** plaguing the farmers of the **Misty Steppe** it's him, though it's uncertain if he can be convinced to come out of retirement.
- **Mira the Witch** who resides in a cottage deep in the **Bone Swamp**. It is said that she is the only living person to know the recipe for **blightbane**, but, as the party is always reminded by the eye missing from one of it's members, her knowledge comes with a steep cost. 
- **The Crimson Hand**, a cabal of scoundrels and rogues fighting to slow the spread of **Empire**.  The party once rescued two of their members from capture by the **Queen's Rangers**, and undoubtedly saved their lives. Now the party seeks the faction's expertise in laying an ambush on a merchant caravan. 

#### Strengthening Ties
A character fosters a connection with an NPC or Faction in the game world. First, they must identify the entity with whom they wish to strengthen ties, as well as a specific intent (e.g., building trust, mending a friendship, seeking membership in a Faction, forming an alliance, and so on). The Warden then provides concrete measures (described as Milestones and Costs) that the PC can undertake to advance the relationship. With each completed Milestone, the Warden describes how the PC’s relationship has grown or changed.

**Examples:**
- After dispatching a **ghoul** that had been feasting on a **wolf den**, a PC hears a whimper from some nearby bushes, finding a lone cub. They decide to keep the creature and raise it as their companion.
- During a play session, a PC becomes friendly with an agent of the **Keepers of the Empty Throne**. Impressed by the faction’s values, the PC asks what the requirements are to join.
- An agent for a powerful faction dies during the **Battle of Frogs** while under the party’s care. Now those responsible wish to provide redress, so that the party can once again perform tasks for that faction.

#### Training
A character can improve their skills with an item or ability, with clear narrative or mechanical results. They might be interested in dealing greater damage with a particular weapon, decreasing their chances of getting lost in rough weather, or learning to read the languages of the ancients. A PC might spend multiple **Downtime Actions** sparring with a particular weapon, improving their skills week by week. Or they may need to travel to the home of a distant sage, improving themselves through short but intense study.

The player must describe precisely what they’d like to improve and a **Master** whom they might train with. And of course, the character’s inspiration to improve should come from an experience in play. The **Warden** should provide any **Milestones** and associated **Costs**.

**Examples:**
- **The Two-Handed Parry:** When fighting with one hand free, a PC’s GD temporarily increases by 1d4. The party took on a hireling from the **Cratered Lands**, whose fighters emphasize avoiding enemy attacks. She has agreed to train anyone who can best her in hand to hand combat.
- **Herbology:** Given proper ingredients, a PC can create a **Healing Salve** (restores 4 STR) as a **Downtime Action**. After receiving care from an elderly herbalist in the **Verdant Glades**, the wounded PC asked to be trained in the healing arts. The **Master** has agreed, but asked that they collect three rare herbs before training can begin.
- **Troutmaster:** When taking the Supply **Action**, **Rations** gathered near cold freshwater sources increase by one step (e.g. 1d4 becomes 1d6). The party escorted a stranded naturalist from the famously dreadful **Silver Wastes** safely back to the city. As thanks, she has offered to train a PC to identify and capture a common lakefish that frequents colder waters.
